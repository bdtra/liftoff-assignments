# Project Outline  

### Overview  
Minimalist website application that allows a user to enter in a keyword and analyze a sample size of posts on twitter to view and evaluate related words to determine upcoming trends or related trending values. Will use a twitter API (TweetInvi) to interface between the application and twitter’s database. The resulting data will then be efficiently displayed to User in either Ascending or Descending order of related-word frequency.  
### Features  
-User defined keywords  
-API interface  
-Data presentation options  
### Technologies  
-C#  
-.NET Core    
-TweetInvi  
### What I'll Have to Learn  
I will have to learn how to use TweetInvi to process search forms and list that data to the user. I will have to learn how to manipulate on demand data so the user is able to view that data efficiently.  
### Project Tracker    
I will be using Trello as my project tracker.
